# QWGraph Documentation

This is the documentation for the python package `qwgraph`. 
This package's aim is to provide an efficient implementation of quantum walks on graphs. 

The quantum walk model implemented in this package follows the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10451 . This model is specifically designed for searching.

Most of the critical functions of this package are implemented and compiled in rust, providing an efficient simulation.
